# gerandoRelatoriosWeb
This project is being made to generate reports with JasperReports and iReport technologies. 
It's disengaged from the database by using the overloaded method fillReport of the class JasperFillManager, passing a DataSource list instead of a connection as a parameter. 
The project still haven't the web implementation yet, under construction!
